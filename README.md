# OggiAuto 2025 – WordPress Theme

A custom WordPress theme built for [OggiAuto.it](https://oggiauto.it).

---

## 🧩 Description

**OggiAuto 2025** is a WordPress theme derived from the **[News Magazine X](https://wp-royal-themes.com/)** theme by **WP Royal Themes**, released under the **GPL v3 or later** license.

This project started as a heavily customized version of that theme.  
I chose **not to create a child theme** because my goal is to **completely refactor and redesign the structure, templates, and styles** — essentially transforming it into a different theme over time.  
A child theme would require overriding most of the parent’s files, defeating its purpose and adding maintenance complexity.  
For now, OggiAuto 2025 is the active theme on [oggiauto.it](https://oggiauto.it).

## 🧠 Why not a child theme?

Although News Magazine X is a great base, my goal is **to rebuild the theme’s structure from the ground up**:
- Create a minimal version of it by removing unused widgets and features  
- Major changes to layout, markup, and file organization  
- Rewritten CSS and template files  
- Simplified and optimized code for performance  

Because these modifications affect almost every part of the parent theme, a child theme would only add complexity.  
Maintaining dozens of overridden templates isn’t practical for long-term development.  
Therefore, this project is developed as a **standalone fork** under the same GPL license.
